# CappCalc

dead simple Calculator, written in Cappuccino.

This is just an experiment of mine in trying to learn objective-J.

I remember a friend showcasing NeXT a "few" years ago and the way he charmed me was by building a Calculator just like this one in a few minutes. I may finally say I can do the same :)
